why school is important to me
As a high school student, school is a pretty important place for me. I spend most of my time in school,
I study in school, eat in school and sleep in school. We always take the idea of "school is important" 
very naturally. But it is really interesting to think why.
Of course, being a student means I spent most of my life in school till now, and this kind of life may
be will continue for more years. However, is it just the amount of time we spent made us felt imprtant?
I don't think so. People will not judge the importance that simply. There must be some other factors
deep inside that affect our feelings.
